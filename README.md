### The Bluesky Twits â›…

(I don't know how I got "bksy" into my head.)

Search for screenshots of tRuMp's tweets and Untruth Social posts via the Bluesky API
(can't kick me off your twit API if I'm not using it), then extract the text and combine
with cartoon villain quotes!

If you know another figure's social handles, you can easily override
`TweetCompiler` to try those out as well.

To run this on your own, you'll need a Bluesky account. Set the following environment
variables:
- `BKSY_USERNAME`: Your account handle, without the ampersand (`@`) - e.g., just `djt-toon-villain.bsky.social`
- `BKSY_APP_PW`: An app password, which you can create in Bluesky via **Settings > Privacy and Security > App passwords**. It doesn't need to have access to your private messages.
