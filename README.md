### The Bluesky Twits â›…

(I don't know how I got "bksy" into my head.)

Search for screenshots of tRuMp's tweets and Untruth Social posts via the Bluesky API
(can't kick me off your twit API if I'm not using it), then extract the text and combine
with cartoon villain quotes!

If you know another figure's social handles, you can easily override
`TweetCompiler` to try those out as well.
